# vim-config

My Vim configuration and extra stuff. Should run on MacVim, Linux (`vim-nox` on Ubuntu usually), and sometimes Windows.

## Setup

`rake install` will download all the submodules and link the configuration to your home directory.

`rake install_extra` will link the files in the extra directory to their dotfile counterparts.
